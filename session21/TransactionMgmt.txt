Transaction Management in JDBC
Transaction represents a single unit of work.

The ACID properties describes the transaction management well. 

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, isolation and durability.

Atomicity means either all successful or none.

Consistency ensures bringing the database from one consistent state to another consistent state.

Isolation ensures that transaction is isolated from other transaction.

Durability means once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of errors, power loss etc.
